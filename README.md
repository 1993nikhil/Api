# Api
This is a web service developed in java.
In this project I have developed a simple login page and after submition of the page it will take your username as an argument an add a string to that.
The main aim of the project is to perform write operation in an API.For that we can use 4 functions GET. POST and other two.
I have used both functions.
apart from lets see how we can run the application.
I have mapped the welcome page to LoginForm.html so that you can enter your username and password.
and after that the page redirects to V1status.java page.
this is the bussiness logic of the application.
It also talks with the database.for database connectivity I have a dao class.
